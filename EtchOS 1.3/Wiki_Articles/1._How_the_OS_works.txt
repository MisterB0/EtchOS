Welcome to the Article "How the OS works", this Article will cover how the
operating system runs and how it is working.

Firstly we need to understand the base structure of the operating system.
There is:

The Bootloader - He is the first thing that starts when you start the computer. 
He also launches the UNIX- and Linux-Kernel.

The Kernel - Based on the open-source database from UNIX and Linux, which builds 
on top of UNIX. The Kernel launches the OS, in this case *TODO: OS*.

*TODO: OS* - The lightweight operating system which includes: File manager, 
system resource manager and other programs that are required to run the phyton OS.

EtchOS - The Phyton based operating system that automaticly launches with the 
Operating System.

Now you know the base structure of the OS and what happens if you start the computer.
I could go much more in deapth, but i have hobbys and no one will read this anyway.
Thanks if you read this until here, have fun!
