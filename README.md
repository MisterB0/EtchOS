# EtchOS
Python Based Terminal Operating System

**History**

This is an little project i worked in my coding class for. It took multiple months and is my first big python project. I built it as an base for easy adding and removing features of your liking. Every release contains an test.py file to develop functions first and then add into main.py. The UI is made with the libary curses and is made using the safe_addstr() function and the window() functions i made. Hope u have fun!
