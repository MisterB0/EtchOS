Troubleshooting — EtchOS (end user)

1) Quick start
- Run the program from a real terminal (PowerShell, Windows Terminal or cmd):
  python "c:\Users\benne\OneDrive\Desktop\Projekte\Code VSC\EtchOS 3.3\main.py"
- Use arrow keys to navigate, Enter to open, Backspace to go up, q or Esc to exit.

2) If the app immediately exits or is blank
- Don't run inside the VS Code Debug Console. Use an integrated terminal (Terminal tab) or an external terminal.
- Check test.log (project root) for exceptions recorded by the harness.

3) Common errors and fixes
- "_curses.error: addwstr() returned ERR" or weird drawing:
  * Terminal too small. Increase the terminal window (more rows/columns) or reduce the font size.
  * Use a larger terminal buffer — the UI writes fixed-position boxes and needs space.

- "NameError" or missing function errors:
  * These are developer issues (missing functions or typos). Copy the exact traceback from test.log and attach it when reporting.

- PermissionError when listing directories:
  * The File Manager skips unreadable folders. To inspect protected system folders run Python with elevated rights (only if you know what you're doing).

- Missing Wiki article (Article not found):
  * The Wiki folder must contain "Article 1.txt", "Article 2.txt", etc. Create them with a text editor if missing.

- On Windows: curses missing / ImportError:
  * Install the compatibility package: pip install windows-curses

- Typo when launching (e.g. "ython"):
  * Use the correct command: python or the full interpreter path:
    C:\Users\benne\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python3.11.exe "path\to\main.py"

4) File Manager tips
- Shows as many items as fit the box. Resize the terminal to display more entries.
- Directories are prefixed with [DIR].
- Use Enter to open directories; Backspace to go to parent.

5) How to collect useful debug info
When reporting a problem include:
- Screenshot or exact terminal output
- Contents of test.log (project root)
- Python version: python --version
- Terminal size: run the one-liner below and paste output:
  python - <<'PY'
  import shutil
  cols, lines = shutil.get_terminal_size()
  print('cols=', cols, 'lines=', lines)
  PY

6) Editing and testing safely
- Make changes in test.py to iterate quickly (it contains a harness).
- When ready, copy the working functions back into main.py.

If these steps don't resolve your issue, attach test.log, describe what you did, your terminal size and Python version — that helps find the bug faster.
